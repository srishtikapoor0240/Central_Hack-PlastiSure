🌱 PlastiSure
Real‑Time Plastic Recyclability Verification using AI & Blockchain
PlastiSure is a real‑time system that verifies plastic type, contamination level, and recyclability using computer vision, and records each verification on a tamper‑proof blockchain ledger.

The goal is simple:
prevent contaminated plastics from entering recycling streams and improve recycling efficiency.

🚀 What PlastiSure Does
📷 Scans plastic items using a live camera feed

🧠 Identifies plastic type using AI

🧪 Detects contamination (food stains, residue, etc.)

📊 Generates a recyclability score (0–100)

🔗 Logs each result on a cryptographically linked blockchain

🟢 Displays instant feedback with clear recommendations

🧠 Why This Matters
A major reason recycling fails is contaminated plastic.
Once contaminated items enter the stream, entire batches often become unusable.

PlastiSure solves this at the point of collection.

Improves recycling efficiency

Reduces manual sorting errors

Enables transparent audits

Scales to recycling plants, waste centers, and smart bins

⚙️ System Overview
Pipeline:

Live Camera Feed
→ AI Plastic Classification
→ Contamination Detection
→ Recyclability Scoring
→ Blockchain Hash Logging
→ Real-Time Visual Feedback
🔐 Blockchain Transparency
Instead of storing raw data, PlastiSure records:

Plastic type

Recyclability score

Timestamp

Previous block hash

Each scan creates a new block linked to the previous one using SHA‑256, forming an immutable audit trail.

This ensures:

Data integrity

Tamper resistance

Regulatory traceability
